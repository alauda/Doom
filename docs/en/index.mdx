# Container Platform Help

## Welcome to Container Platform

Container Platform (hereinafter referred to as the platform or container platform) embraces cloud-native technology. By integrating Docker containers, Kubernetes native architecture, microservices, and other related new technologies and concepts, it enables the platform-based management of the entire lifecycle of business applications, from development and testing to deployment and operation. It can effectively help enterprises achieve digital transformation and enhance their IT delivery capabilities and competitiveness.

This platform is an enterprise-level cloud-native container platform that can serve enterprises of different scales. It supports the management of infrastructure environments of various complexities (single machines or multiple heterogeneous data centers) and well-structured departmental organizations and personnel teams.

This platform can meet the extensive needs of enterprise-level applications transitioning to containerization and microservices, supporting enterprises in establishing a private cloud platform that covers internal and external processes and organizational structures. It improves the utilization of enterprise IT resources, accelerates application iteration speed, reduces application delivery costs, enables intelligent operation and maintenance of business applications, and thereby helps enterprises gain core capabilities for continuous innovation.
