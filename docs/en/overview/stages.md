# Stages of development

The platform's features can be divided into Alpha, Beta, and GA (General Availability) versions according to their maturity.

The features in Beta and GA versions are stable or in the process of stable iteration, with professional teams providing support and services. You can use the corresponding features in the production environment according to your actual needs.

The features in Alpha version may have defects or serious bugs, and are not deployed in the production environment by default. They are only recommended for testing the platform's functions in a test environment.

To facilitate the distinction of Alpha version features, the navigation menu of the corresponding functional module or specific function will be marked with `Alpha` on the left side of the document's directory structure. For example, Create subnet (Alpha).

Please refer to the table below for the explanation of the maturity of platform features and the recommended usage range.

| Alpha    | May have defects or errors, and serious bugs may be encountered after enabling.<br>The supported features may be deleted without notice.<br>Changes in API, product scenario encapsulation, interaction process, etc. may cause compatibility issues, but will not be specifically declared in subsequent version releases.<br>If the dependent Kubernetes function is in Alpha version, the corresponding platform function can only be in Alpha version. | Alpha version features are disabled by default when deploying in a private environment. If needed, they can be enabled by configuring relevant parameters during deployment.<br>Due to the risk of bugs and the possibility of no long-term support, it is recommended to use them in a short-term functional experience or test environment, such as a POC environment.                                          |
| **Beta** | May contain defects, but all supported features will not be easily removed.<br>API parameters, product design details, etc. may change with version iterations. In such cases, we will provide instructions for migrating to the next version. Careful operation is required when performing editing operations, and it may be necessary to disable applications that depend on this feature.                                                              | Beta version features are enabled by default and can be disabled by configuring relevant parameters during deployment.<br>There may be incompatible changes in subsequent versions, so it is recommended to use it only for non-critical business operating environments. If there are multiple clusters that can be independently upgraded, this restriction can be relaxed and used in production environments. |
| **GA**   | A stable version of the feature that will appear in many subsequent versions.<br>API parameters, product design details, etc. may change with long-term support versions. In such cases, we will provide instructions for migrating to the next version.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Suitable for all environments, including production environments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
