# MDX

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is an extended syntax of Markdown that allows the use of JSX syntax within Markdown. For usage, you can refer to [rspress MDX](https://rspress.dev/zh/guide/basic/use-mdx).

## rspress Components

The `rspress` theme provides a majority of the [built-in components](https://rspress.dev/zh/guide/default-theme/components) as global components, which can be used directly in `.mdx` files without import, including:

- `Badge`
- `Card`
- `LinkCard`
- `PackageManagerTabs`
- `Steps`
- `Tab/Tabs`
- `Toc`

Other less frequently used components can be imported from `@rspress/core/theme`, for example:

```mdx title="preview.mdx"
import { SourceCode } from '@rspress/core/theme'

<SourceCode href="/" />
```

## doom Components

`doom` provides some global components to assist in document writing, which can be used directly without import. Currently, these include:

### `Overview`

Component for document overview, used to display the document directory.

### `Directive`

Sometimes, due to nested indentation, the [custom container](https://rspress.dev/zh/guide/basic/use-mdx#%E8%87%AA%E5%AE%9A%E4%B9%89%E5%AE%B9%E5%99%A8) syntax may become invalid. The `Directive` component can be used as a substitute.

```mdx
- The directory structure of multi-language documents (`doc/en`) needs to be fully consistent with the documents under the `doc/zh` directory to ensure that the links of multi-language documents are identical except for the language identifier.

  <Directive type="danger" title="Attention">
    If automated translation tools are used for translation, there is no need to
    worry about this issue, as the automated translation tools will
    automatically generate the directory structure of the target language
    documents based on `doc/zh`.
  </Directive>
```

    documents based on `doc/zh`.
  </Directive>

### `ExternalSite`

Component to reference external sites.

```mdx
<ExternalSite name="connectors" />
```

<ExternalSite name="connectors" />

### `ExternalSiteLink`

Component to reference external site links.

```mdx
<ExternalSiteLink name="connectors" href="link.mdx#hash" children="Content" />
```

<ExternalSiteLink name="connectors" href="link.mdx#hash" children="Content" />

:::tip

In mdx, `<ExternalSiteLink name="connectors" href="link" children="Content" />` has a different meaning from the content below

```mdx
<ExternalSiteLink name="connectors" href="link">
  Content {/* this will be rendered inside a `p` element */}
</ExternalSiteLink>
```

If you do not want the text to be rendered inside a `p` element, you can use the `children` attribute as shown in the example above.

:::

### `AcpApisOverview` and `ExternalApisOverview`

Components to reference external site API overviews.

```mdx
<AcpApisOverview />
{/* the same as the following */}
<ExternalApisOverview name="acp" />

<ExternalApisOverview name="connectors" />
```

<AcpApisOverview />

<ExternalApisOverview name="connectors" />

### Term

Term component for plain text, dynamically mounted for injection.

```mdx
<Term name="company" textCase="capitalize" />
<Term name="product" textCase="lower" />
<Term name="productShort" textCase="upper" />
```

<Term name="company" textCase="capitalize" />

<Term name="product" textCase="lower" />

<Term name="productShort" textCase="upper" />

#### `props`

- `name`: Built-in term name, refer to [dynamic mounting configuration file](./deploy.md#overrides).
- `textCase`: Text case transformation, optional values are `lower`, `upper`, `capitalize`.

### `TermsTable`

Component for displaying a list of built-in terms.

```mdx
<TermsTable />
```

<TermsTable />

#### `props`

- `terms`: `NormalizedTermItem[]`, optional, a custom term list for reusing when rendering custom terms in internal documentation.

### `JsonViewer`

```mdx
<JsonViewer value={{ key: 'value' }} />
```

<JsonViewer value={{ key: 'value' }} />

## Custom Component Reuse

According to [conventions](./convention), we can extract reusable content to the `shared` directory, then import it where needed, for example:

```mdx
import CommonContent from './shared/CommonContent.mdx'

<CommonContent />
```

If you need to use more [runtime](https://rspress.dev/zh/api/client-api/api-runtime) related APIs, you can implement components using `.jsx/.tsx` and then import them into `.mdx` files.

```tsx
// shared/CommonContent.tsx
export const CommonContent = () => {
  const { page } = usePageData()
  return <div>{page.title}</div>
}

// showcase/content.mdx
import { CommonContent } from './shared/CommonContent'
;<CommonContent />
```

:::warning
Note: Currently, components exported from `.mdx` do not support passing `props`. For scenarios where `props` need to be passed, please use `.jsx/.tsx` components for development, refer to [this issue](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rspress/issues/1555).
