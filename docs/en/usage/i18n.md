# Internationalization

Most of the internal documentation for `alauda` is bilingual in Chinese and English. Therefore, we default to supporting the use of `en`/`zh` subfolders to store documentation in different languages. It is recommended to also store static resources in `en`/`zh` subfolders under the `public` directory, which facilitates the management of documentation content and static resources.

## `i18n.json`

For reusable components that need to support both Chinese and English within the same component, you must first create an `i18n.json` file in the `docs` directory. Then, you can use `useI18n` in the component to retrieve the text in the current language, for example:

```json title=docs/i18n.json
{
  "title": {
    "zh": "标题",
    "en": "Title"
  },
  "description": {
    "zh": "描述",
    "en": "description"
  }
}
```

## `.ts/.tsx`

```tsx
import { useI18n } from '@rspress/runtime'

export const CommonContent = () => {
  const t = useI18n()
  return <h1>{t('title')}</h1>
}
```

## `.mdx`

```mdx
import { useI18n } from '@rspress/runtime'

# {useI18n()('title')}

{useI18n()('description')}
```
