The Container Platform can effectively assist enterprises in digital transformation, intelligent IT infrastructure, and empower IT departments of small and medium-sized enterprises to play a dual role as business supporters and drivers through platform-based infrastructure, agile application delivery, automated operation and maintenance management, and service-oriented IT governance.

- Platform-based infrastructure management

  Fully integrated with the Kubernetes container orchestration engine, the platform provides unified management after docking with Kubernetes business clusters and platforms, and provides a sound container network and storage solution to form a platform-based infrastructure.

- Efficient container services

  Flexible application orchestration and delivery ensure application delivery in multiple scenarios. At the same time, Docker is used to manage applications, which occupies less space, has high resource utilization, and can be easily and quickly deployed through Docker commands.

- Automated operation and maintenance management

  Provide an intelligent operation and maintenance experience centered on applications from both user and management perspectives, shield the underlying operation and maintenance infrastructure, and allow users to focus more on core business.

- Service-oriented IT governance

  Support multi-tenant management scenarios for small and medium-sized enterprises, achieve fine-grained permission control and self-service IT governance. Unified management and monitoring of resources on different infrastructure environments, and ensure system security through security audit mechanisms.

## Product features

- Seamless docking with Kubernetes

  Deeply integrated with the Kubernetes container orchestration engine, providing standard Kubernetes container orchestration services. The platform better leverages the product features of Kubernetes, supports one-click deployment of business clusters and networks, supports automated deployment, expansion, and management of container applications, and can integrate storage, monitoring, logs, and other solutions as needed. Containerized management of computing components allows the entire platform to manage applications like managing products, further improving resource utilization.

- Multi-cluster management

  Supports managing native Kubernetes clusters deployed through AKE (Alauda Kubernetes Engine, a Kubernetes installer) or other third-party platforms, providing unified management of Kubernetes clusters across different cloud environments.

  Unified multi-cluster management of clusters and nodes in different infrastructure environments ensures fault migration, enabling enterprises to quickly and effectively run clusters across regions and platforms at low cost.

- Enterprise-level multi-tenant management

  Building on support for a free user system, integrates with LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) or OAuth 2.0 protocols to incorporate existing enterprise user systems, with user permissions set at a granular level through RBAC.

  Supports project management based on multi-tenancy, with projects sharing platform infrastructure resources and resources allocated according to project needs. The platform's enterprise-level multi-tenant management capabilities greatly simplify the repetitive work of assigning identical resource permissions to members with the same role, facilitate resource isolation within and outside projects, and enhance data confidentiality.
