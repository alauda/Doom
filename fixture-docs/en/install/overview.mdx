# Installation Overview

The platform architecture and key features are as follows:

- **Architecture Design**

  - **Management Cluster**: Responsible for the core management of the platform, providing cluster, tenant management, and global scheduling. After the management cluster is installed, business clusters can be added or created as needed.
  - **Business Cluster**: Specifically designed to bear business workloads and supports horizontal scaling. Business clusters can be independently deployed or connected through existing clusters that meet version requirements.

- **Design Principles**

  1. **Control Plane Isolation Deployment**
     When installing the management cluster, dedicated physical resources must be used and not shared with business clusters to ensure the stability and security of the control plane.
  2. **Hybrid Deployment Compatibility**
     In development and testing environments or resource-constrained situations, it is allowed to run business workloads simultaneously on the management cluster (i.e., the global cluster), enabling co-location of management and business functionality.
  3. **Standardized Access Specifications**
     Two methods for accessing business clusters are supported:
     - New business cluster (recommended)
     - Connecting to existing clusters that meet version requirements (pre-inspection required)
