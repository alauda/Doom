# Installation

This section outlines the specific steps for installing the management cluster. The following operations follow the "Prepare → Execute → Validate" model, and key parameter descriptions are detailed in the UI configuration.

### Step 1: Download the Installation Package

**Prepare**

- Log in to the **Customer Portal** to obtain the latest installation package and signature files.
- If you have not registered an account yet, please contact technical support.

**Execute**

- After the download is complete, use the GPG tool to verify the integrity of the installation package.
- Install GPG tool according to your operating system (refer to the commands below).

```bash
# Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install gnupg
# CentOS
yum install gnupg
# Mac
brew install gpg
```

**Validate**
Follow the steps below to validate:

#### 1.1 Download and Verify the Public Key

```bash
curl -O https://www.alauda.cn/download/verify-key.pub
md5sum verify-key.pub
```

- The output MD5 value should be: `2eaddfab97d2951a8915f327acb53562`.

#### 1.2 Import Public Key and Verify Fingerprint

```bash
gpg --import verify-key.pub
gpg --fingerprint BB097AE6
```

- The fingerprint should match exactly:
  ```
  09EE E7B9 A30C F4B3 5E31 A91B 2704 1C16 BB09 7AE6
  ```

#### 1.3 Verify the Installation Package Signature

```bash
gpg --verify <signature file> <installation package>
```

For example:

```bash
gpg --verify cpaas-devops-2.14.0.tgz.sig cpaas-devops-2.14.0.tgz
```

- A normal output should display "Good signature" information.

### Step 2: Upload the Installation Package to the Control Node

**Prepare**

- Ensure the target control node is network accessible and has sufficient storage (at least 100GB after extraction).

**Execute**

- Upload the installation package to the suggested directory on the control node `/root/cpaas-install`, and extract it:

```shell
tar -xvf {path_to_installation_package}/{installation_package_name} -C /root/cpaas-install
cd /root/cpaas-install/installer || exit 1
```

**Validate**

- Check if the extracted directory structure is complete.

---

### Step 3: Start the Installer

**Prepare**

- Ensure the control node is network accessible and the PC can access its IP.
- Check that dependencies are configured as per prerequisites.

**Execute**

- Start the installer by default (using the Kube-OVN network plugin):

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

- To use the Calico network plugin, execute:

```bash
bash setup.sh --network-mode calico
```

- To specify IPv6 or dual-stack mode, you can add the parameters `--ip-family ipv6` or `--ip-family dual`.

**Validate**

- After starting the installer, the command-line terminal will output the Web UI access address; wait about 5 minutes and access the page on the PC to confirm it loads correctly.

---

### Step 4: Install the Management Cluster (Configure UI Parameters)

**Prepare**
In the Web UI, configure the key parameters for installing the management cluster as prompted, with details as follows:

- **Kubernetes Version**

  - All optional versions have been strictly tested.
  - It is recommended to choose the latest version for optimal features and support.

- **Cluster Network Protocol**

  - Supports IPv4 single-stack, IPv6 single-stack, and IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack.
  - Note: When selecting dual-stack mode, all nodes must be correctly configured with IPv6 addresses; the network protocol setting cannot be changed once configured.

- **Cluster Address**

  - Enter the prepared `global VIP` for external access to the kube-apiserver.
  - If a LoadBalancer is configured, please fill in its VIP address and disable "Self-built VIP"; otherwise, enable "Self-built VIP" and enter the requested VIP, the installer will automatically deploy keepalived.

- **Platform Access Address**

  - Enter the prepared `External IP` or domain name.
  - HTTPS access is enabled by default; if HTTP is needed, enable it in the advanced settings.
  - Supports multiple address configurations: you can fill in internal addresses and add external addresses in "Other Settings > Other Platform Access Addresses."

- **Certificate**

  - Defaults to using self-signed certificates to support HTTPS.
  - To customize the certificate, please upload the existing certificate.

- **Image Repository**

  - Defaults to using the platform-deployed image repository, which includes all component images.
  - If you need to use an external image repository, please contact technical support to obtain an image synchronization plan for configuration.

- **Container Network**

  - The default subnet and Service range for the management cluster must not overlap.
  - When using the Kube-OVN Overlay network, ensure the container network and host network are not in the same subnet to prevent network anomalies.

- **Node Name**

  - If you choose "Use Hostname as Node Name," please ensure all node hostnames are unique.

- **Global Cluster Platform Node Isolation**

  - Enable this when planning to run workloads on the management cluster.
  - Once enabled, nodes can be set to "Platform Exclusive," meaning they will only run platform components; DaemonSet types are an exception.

- **Add Node**
  - **Control Node**:
    - You can add 1 or 3 control nodes (3 is for high availability configuration).
    - If "Platform Exclusive" is enabled, disable "Deployable Apps," and the control nodes will only run platform components; otherwise, you can choose whether to enable "Deployable Apps."
  - **Compute Node**:
    - If "Platform Exclusive" is enabled, disable "Deployable Apps"; otherwise, it must be enabled.
  - When using Kube-OVN, you can specify the node network card by entering the gateway name.
  - If the node availability check fails, please adjust as prompted on the page and re-add.

**Execute**

- Fill out the configuration parameters in accordance with the Web UI prompts, then start the installation wizard for installation.

**Validate**

- Once the installation is complete, the page will display the platform access address and installation status; if there are errors, please make adjustments as indicated.

---

### Step 5: Verify the Installation Success

**Prepare**

- Log into the platform Web UI and confirm the management cluster status.

**Execute**

- In the "Platform Management" view, click on "Cluster Management > Cluster," and find the cluster named `global`;
- Select "CLI Tools" from the drop-down menu on the right and execute the following commands to check the status:

```shell
# Check for any failed Charts
kubectl get apprelease --all-namespaces
# Check for any failed Pods
kubectl get pod --all-namespaces | awk '{if ($4 != "Running" && $4 != "Completed")print}' | awk -F'[/ ]+' '{if ($3 != $4)print}'
```

**Validate**

- Verify that the output results contain no anomalies or failures.
- If there are exceptions, please refer to the troubleshooting guide for resolution.

**Browser Compatibility Notice**
It is recommended to access the platform using the following browsers:

- **Google Chrome**: Version 93 and above
- **Firefox**: Version 92 and above
