# Application and Workload Selection

## Application Selection

The platform currently provides five types of applications: OAM application, native application, template application, and component application. Each application type has its applicable scenarios. Additionally, the platform offers GitOps management, thus it is necessary to select an application based on real environments and different dimensions. The selection process is as follows:

1. If there are historical legacies (baggage, community, open source), choose the currently used application type.

   - Baggage: Current projects use historically inherited technologies, decisions, or code.

   - Community: The current project is influenced by the cultural and decision-making practices of the community or the early history of the project.

   - Open source: There are some historical legacies in open source that have impacted the current state of the project.

2. If there are no historical legacies, selection can be based on the following content. Here, ❌ indicates no need; ✅ indicates need or allowance; ⭐️ indicates the level of skill or cost requirement. More stars indicate higher skill or cost requirements, allowing you to choose according to actual conditions.

   **Reference Dimension Explanations**:

   - **Business Application Complexity**: The number of computing components within the application; more computing components make it more complex.

   - **Requirement for Kubernetes Expertise**: The level of mastery of various concepts and technologies within Kubernetes.

   - **Need for Business Disaster Recovery**: Whether it is necessary to set disaster recovery for business (the ability to maintain business operations in the event of catastrophic incidents such as natural disasters, hardware failures, network failures, etc.).

   - **Allow third-party users to access**: Whether users are allowed to package their applications via Helm Chart or Operator and provide them for third-party users.

## Workload Selection

The platform provides five types of workloads: Deployment, DaemonSet, StatefulSet, Job, and CronJob. Each workload type has applicable scenarios, so it is necessary to select the appropriate workload. However, in practical application, it may be necessary to combine multiple workloads to construct a complete application system. For example, a complete application may include:

- Using Deployment to deploy front-end and back-end services
- Using StatefulSet to deploy databases
- Using DaemonSet to deploy log collection components
- Using CronJob to execute scheduled backup tasks

| Workload Type   | Features                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Selection Recommendations                                                                                                                                           |

| **Deployment**  | <ul><li>Supports horizontal scaling</li><li>Supports rolling updates and rollbacks</li><li>Pod names are random and will change after restart</li><li>Suitable for scenarios that process requests in parallel</li></ul> | If it is a stateless application (e.g., web services, API services, front-end applications, microservices), this type should be prioritized.                        |
| **DaemonSet**   | <ul><li>Runs one Pod on each node</li><li>Automatically deploys Pods on new nodes</li><li>Automatically cleans up Pods when nodes are removed</li><li>Supports selective node deployment</li></ul>                       | If it needs to run on every node (e.g., log collection, monitoring, storage services, network plugins), choose this type.                                           |
| **StatefulSet** | <ul><li>Pod names are fixed and ordered</li><li>Provides stable network identities</li><li>Supports persistent storage</li><li>Deploys and scales in order</li></ul>                                                     | If the application requires fixed network identities or persistent storage (e.g., databases, distributed caches, message queues, search engines), choose this type. |
| **Job**         | <ul><li>Ensures task completion</li><li>Supports parallel execution of multiple Pods</li><li>Automatically cleans up after tasks are completed</li><li>Can set retry counts</li></ul>                                    | If it is a one-time task (e.g., data migration, file processing, batch calculations, sending emails), choose this type.                                             |
| **CronJob**     | <ul><li>Runs jobs on a scheduled basis</li><li>Supports Cron expressions</li><li>Can configure task history retention policy</li><li>Can pause and resume scheduling</li></ul>                                           | If it is a periodic task (e.g., data backups, report generation, cleanup tasks, scheduled notifications), choose this type.                                         |
