When performing internationalization translations, the following guidelines must be observed:

- The directory structure of multilingual documents (`doc/en`) must exactly match that of the documents in the `doc/zh` directory, ensuring that the links to the multilingual documents are identical except for the language identifier.

  ::: danger
  If automated translation tools are being used, this issue can be disregarded, as these tools will automatically generate the directory structure for the target language documents based on `doc/zh`.
