The following specifications must be followed during the internationalization translation process:

- The directory structure of the multilingual documents (`doc/en`) must be identical to the documents under the `doc/zh` directory, ensuring that the links to the multilingual documents are exactly the same except for the language identifier.

  ::: danger
  If an automated translation tool is used for the translation, there is no need to be concerned about this issue, as the automated translation tool will automatically generate the directory structure for the target language documents based on `doc/zh`.
