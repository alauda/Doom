1. What is an Introduction

The "Introduction" section serves as the opening of product documentation or functionality modules, providing an overall description of the product or functionality. It covers core concepts, key features, target users, and intended usage, offering readers a clear preliminary understanding.

We typically determine the presence of the Introduction, Advantages, and Feature Overview sections in a single document based on the overall length of the article. For complex products (such as platform products that contain multiple core modules), it is recommended to separate these contents into independent documents; for single functionality modules, they can be combined in the same document.

2. Importance of the Introduction

Given that products or functionality modules may involve many points, adding an introduction at the beginning can:

- Foster a unified understanding: It provides a consistent recognition upfront, reducing communication errors.
- Guide reading: It presents a clear product background to help readers delve into subsequent detailed contents.
- Enhance efficiency: It reduces the time spent on repetitive explanations regarding the fundamental understanding of the product.

3. How to Conceptualize the Introduction Section

- Concise and clear: Summarize the core points of the product using straightforward language, avoiding verbosity.
- Highlight key points: Emphasize the unique selling points and main functions of the product.
- Audience-oriented: Consider the background of the target audience and provide the information that concerns them.

4. Unique Aspects of the Introduction

This template provides a standardized framework for describing functionality modules within documents. By utilizing structured content organization and clear expression, it aids teams in effectively communicating the product functionality value, allowing users to quickly understand and utilize the product features.

There are some differences between product-level introductions and module-level introductions:

Characteristics of Product-Level Introductions

- **Product Positioning**: Clearly articulate the productâ€™s position within the industry and its competitive advantages.
- **Complete Ecosystem**: Describe all core modules and functionality frameworks included in the product.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: The applicable scenarios for the product will be more comprehensive and should be explained in conjunction with the characteristics of different modules.

Characteristics of Module-Level Introductions

- **Module Positioning**: Clarify the role and responsibilities of the module within the product.
- **Module Features**: Focus on describing the characteristics and advantages of a single module.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: Emphasize the supported scenarios relevant to the single module.
